An attempt to create a networked Megaman X platformer combat game using pygame, taking inspiration from Super Smash Brothers and Jazz Jackrabbit 2's multiplayer.

Currently two or more players can be in the same level if on one computer, in a separate terminal window from the game, the network/server.py file is run. Very rudimentary and prone to lag so far.
